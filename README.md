**Description:**  
You are trapped in a dark, shifting labyrinth. A relentless entity hunts you, its presence growing closer with every step. Your only salvation lies in assembling a weapon—but not to fight, only to escape.

**Notes:**
- The entity is always moving.
- Gather the pieces before it finds you.
- The labyrinth changes each time.
- In the end, there is no victory—only release.
